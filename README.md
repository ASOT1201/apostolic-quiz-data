## 📌 Maintaining File Structure

The following rules must ALWAYS be followed:

- `index.html` must stay in the **root** folder  
- `assets/` and `quizzes/` must also stay in the **root**  
- **Never** place files in a folder named `INDEX.HTML` (this breaks GitHub Pages)
- Avoid uppercase filenames

Correct file structure ensures Skool embeds load properly.
